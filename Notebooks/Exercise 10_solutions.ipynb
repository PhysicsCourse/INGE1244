    "### Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "A frequency $f$ is always given as the inverse of a period $T$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f=\\frac{1}{T}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The period of the relaxation oscillator is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$T_{osc}=2ln(2)RC$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus the frequency of the oscillator is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f_{osc}=\\frac{1}{2ln(2)RC}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which will be approximated (read the note) to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f_{osc}=\\frac{1}{RC}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "The filter presented in (a) is a **low pass filter**, signifying that it **transmits low frequencies** - frequencies lower than the cut-off frequency (noted $f_{cut}$) are **\"OK\"**), and **attenuates high frequencies** (frequencies above $f_{cut}$ are **\"KO\"**).\n",
    "\n",
    "The filter presented in (b) is a **high pass filter**, signifying that it **transmits high frequencies** (higher than $f_{cut}$), and **attenuates low frequencies** (lower than $f_{cut}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "The cut-off frequency of the oscillator is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f_{cut}=\\frac{1}{R^{*}C^{*}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a pictural reminder:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img title=\"a title\" alt=\"Alt text\" src=\"../Figures/Exercise 10/reminder.png\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal, for the rest of this session will be to locate $f_{osc}$ in the suitable \"region\" (\"OK\" means transmitted and \"KO\", not transmitted - strongly attenuated).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "The strategy is first to compute $f_{osc}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f_{osc}=\\frac{1}{RC}=\\frac{1}{10\\times10^{3}\\times1\\times10^{-9}}[s^{-1}]=0.1\\times10^{6}\\;[Hz]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "then, to compute the cut-off frequency of the filter $f_{cut}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f_{cut}=\\frac{1}{R^{*}C^{*}}=\\frac{1}{10\\times10^{3}\\times1\\times10^{-12}}[s^{-1}]=100\\times10^{6}\\;[Hz]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The conclusion goes as follow: the frequency of the oscillator is way smaller than the cut-off frequency of the filter ($f_{osc}<f_{cut}$). Since it is a **low pass filter**, the signal coming from the oscillator is in the \"OK\" region of the filter and so, it is transmitted. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In this question, the cut-off frequency of the filter is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f_{cut}=\\frac{1}{R^{*}C^{*}}=\\frac{1}{10\\times10^{3}\\times100\\times10^{-12}}[s^{-1}]=10\\times10^{6}\\;[Hz]$$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, $f_{osc}<f_{cut}$ but this time, it \"falls\" into the \"KO\" region of the **high pass filter**. Not signal is not properly transmitted. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Answer 1. Even if one did not know about $f_{cut}$ or $f_{osc}$, the figure informs us on the fact that the signal (blue curve) is not properly transmitted (red curve). During the segment number (2), the oscillator signal is \"OFF\" - the voltage is 0. Which can only mean that the capacitor is **discharging** into the resistor - there is no power supply. \n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-danger\">\n",
    "By only looking at the curve, one could na√Øvely think that, since the curve rises, the capacitor is charging. No. It is discharging into the resistor.  \n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Answer 2. **If** I reduce the distance $d$ between the capacitor plates, **then** the capacitance $C^{*}$ **increases** (Indeed, $C=\\frac{\\epsilon A}{d}$). Doing so, the cut-off frequency of the filter **decreases** (indeed $f_{cut}=\\frac{1}{R^{*}C^{*}}$). Eventually, the situation where the signal is filtered (with the condition $f_{osc}<f_{cut}$) becomes a situation where the signal is **not** filtered ($f_{osc}>f_{cut}$) - \"OK\" region of the **high pass** filter.
